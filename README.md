Processing Sketches for Graphic Designers


A series of Processing sketches that introduce some common approaches to working with data sets. These sketches were developed for a school project at l'Ã©sad d'Amiens, France. The project was based on thinking about how to use data differently as opposed to just using data for eye candy graphics.
